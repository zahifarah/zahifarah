- Hi, I’m @zahifarah and I'm a film director turned developer.
- Web 3.0 and Blockchain Development
- Just about to complete Colt Steele's Full Stack Web Development course.
- Tech, Tools & Languages: Mongoose, Express, React, Node, Bootstrap 4/5, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, CLI and a few more :)
- Looking to collaborate on Blockchain related projects. Privacy, Digital Identity, Oracle Networks, Cybersecurity, Decentralized Internet, Decentralized Storage and NFTs are some of the topics I find particularly interesting.
